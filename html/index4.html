            <h2>Xiaomi PAD 5 – A worthy iPad competitor?</h2>
            <img src="PAD5.jpg" alt="PAD5" width="500" height="300" ali>
            <p>The Xiaomi Pad 5 maks Xiaomi’s return to the tablet space in India after years of wait! The tablet will go on sale from May 3 and be available with launch offers. And as with all Xiaomi products, it carries a stellar price tag, considering all the specs it packs inside. In fact, the Xiaomi Pad ends up being the most powerful tablet in its price range. Let’s look at Xiaomi’s Pad 5 and if this is the best bang for your buck today!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>BUILT TO PERFORM</h2>
            <p>Instead of stelling for a midrange chipset, the Xiaomi Pad 5 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 paired with up to 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This combination of specs still packs a punch as even heavier games such as Genshin Impact play smoothly at its default medium setting. Xiaomi uses a new MIUI for Pad, which is more optimized for the tablet with dedicated features such as multitasking via split-screen and floating windows. Fo audio, the Pad 5 gets a Quad Speaker setup.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>RUN TIME AND CHARGING</h2>
            <p>Needless to say, you won’t be charging this device every day. The Xiaomi Pad 5 relies on a massive 8720mAh battery, supports 33W fast charging support, and has enough juice to last you multiple rounds of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang before it reaches critically low levels.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>UP FOR SOME TABLET PHOTOGRAPHY?</h2>
            <p>The Xiaomi Pad 5 comes packed with an 8MP selfie camera and a 13MP rear camera, which performs well for a tablet. These are best used for scanning documents and casual food photos; this camera can produce decent-looking shots and video calls.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Coming back to the project MULTICS, as we all know, too many cooks spoil the brook, the situation here was similar. 
                The team of MULTICS had a lot of smart people banging their heads together overloaded with ideas for this special OS, which not only made the project lengthier but also too complex. Soon the project was scrapped and a year of hard work was pushed down the drain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>OTHER SPECS TO LOOK AT</h2>
            <p>The Xiaomi Pad 5 offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, an 11-inch WQHD+ IPS LCD with a ratio of 16:10, and a dedicated ambient light sensor. The display also supports True Colours and Dolby Vision, allowing you to binge-watch Netflix shows in the whole mood.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Xiaomi has also launched a Xiaomi Pad 5 Keyboard accessory with 12mm deep travel. There is also a Smart Pen made for the Xiaomi Pad 5. Note that you need to buy these accessories separately.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Xiaomi Pad 5 is an excellent & well-rounded device that would pair well with almost anyone looking to own a tablet.
            </p>
