            <h2>UNIX – Where It All Began</h2>
            <img src="UNIX.png">
            <p>Being a person in this wondrous field of programming and computer automation I have always wondered how did this all start? 
                Who is the mother of every operating system that exists today? 
                Believe me or not, all the smallest embedded systems to high end graphic systems, 
                what is the most powerful operating system that ever existed? It is just a four letter word – UNIX.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>UNIX is the mother of all operating systems. 
                It’s the source of the origin of Windows, macOS, Android, and the thousand other operating systems today. 
                UNIX is the reason we have the internet and cloud and the AI systems that make life so easy and automated today. 
                UNIX made computer graphics possible. 
                And if you want to know how and where all this started you need to endorse on the journey of UNIX with me.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Long back in 1965, 3 Companies/organizations shook hands and decided to create an OS that was multi-user, multi-sharing, and multi-tasking. 
                Not that there was no OS before that, But none possessed the qualities that these organizations desired and dreamed of. 
                The companies were none other than AT and T Bells, General electric, and Mac (Multiple Access Computational Team) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
                They all decided to name this OS as MULTICS – Multiplexed Information Computing services.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>There were 3 teams formed from each organization who came together to start developing the dream OS. 
                Each organization sent their best employee for the task. 
                Kane Thompson was one of the geniuses who worked at AT&T Bells at that time. 
                An Electrical Engineer graduated from the University Of Berkley’s and is also known for developing the coding language B, a predecessor of C. 
                Another known name who was representing the MaC from MIT was Dennis Ritchie. 
                We all know him as the founder of C – Mother of all Programming languages. 
                A Master’s degree holder in Physics, taught at MIT until UNIX happened. 
                There were many such pioneers in this team but these two played the key role as we shall see later in the article.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Coming back to the project MULTICS, as we all know, too many cooks spoil the brook, the situation here was similar. 
                The team of MULTICS had a lot of smart people banging their heads together overloaded with ideas for this special OS, which not only made the project lengthier but also too complex. Soon the project was scrapped and a year of hard work was pushed down the drain.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The interesting part was that the team internally formed great bonds and this led to new friendships.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In the year 1969, an opportunity opened in front of Ken Thompson. AT and T Bells wanted an office automation editing system for which they reached out to the R&D Department. It was none other than Ken Thompson who saw the similarity of this system with the OS that they were developing 4 years ago. He taught of this as a great opportunity to complete the dream he once saw under the disguise of a simple Office automation editing system. Not later than that he called Dennis Ritchie who took up the job in AT and T bells and together they began the development of something that would change the future of Computers.
