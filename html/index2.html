            <h2>Top 5 Programming Languages</h2>
            <img src="LANG.jpg" alt="LANG" width="500" height="300" ali>
            <p>For a while, just a few companies regarded computer programmers with innovative coding expertise. Many IT workers now require a strong understanding of the top languages of programming.
                In case you’re trying to advance your career or change your career, you may wonder which one you’re going to learn? Hence making a right decision depends on time and money invested in learning the language.
                If you want to create a mobile application, receive certification for programming competence, or gain new skills, you need to learn the right programming language. For aspiring to master this profession, consider a few important but easy things to decide, such as the level of complexity that you will learn, the expertise that you already possess that aligns with your current coding skills, or your motives for learning the right programming language.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To enlighten the starting developers, listed below are a few options-
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Python</h3>
            <p>It is one of the most used programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because of its readability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>“Python will be the most popular programming language for developers in 2021,” says Artur Yolchyan, Senior Software Engineer and owner of the Coding Skills website.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The language is free, open-source, scalable platform with comprehensive support modules and community development, simple web service integration, data structures and GUI-based Desktop applications. Python is used to create 2D image and 3D animation packages such as Blender, Inkscape and Autodesk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It is an excellent medium for artificial intelligence, machine learning, other areas of data science and comprehensive learning. Python is the hottest data science application used to analyse business growth and data. This includes extensive libraries that make easy to execute the code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Starting a learning journey through Python.org, which provides a helpful beginner’s guide, is a considerable choice for pioneering learners. Microsoft has a video series, “Python for Beginners,” with hundreds of quick lessons related to Python.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. JavaScript</h3>
            <p>One of the top programming languages, growing at a higher pace- JavaScript, which is diving in new power for the upcoming times. It interprets this platform as a programming language and lightweight demanding for network-centric application creation. When combined with HTMP, can help you build great backend and frontend applications, making it easy to set up. We can add various frameworks in this programming language, such as Node.JS and jQuery, bringing new functionality to the development cycle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In fact, JavaScript will remain a powerful engine well beyond 2021, in particular because new generations of students use it for the scripted behave of websites. Millions of websites also depend on libraries and frameworks from third-party JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Java</h3>
            <p>Java is one of today’s most popular computer programming languages. Owned by Oracle Corporation, this overall programming language with object-orientated structure has become a standard for apps which, for their Write Once, Run anywhere (WORA) capacities, can operate without platform (e.g. Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) and also excludes explicit pointing, security manager capabilities, secure code language, comprehensive API. There are over 3 billion devices running Java-based applications for their portability across platforms, from mainframe data centres to smartphones. It’s used in web and application creation and on the backend of a range of common websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter and YouTube. Also, very common are the latest Java frameworks like Spring, Struts and Hibernate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. C and C++</h3>
            <p>C++ is an improved version of C and is a primary developers’ syntax programming language. While Python is a big platform in the competitive world, C++ is without question a great platform. It comprises a variety of problem-solving algorithms and helps developers find the correct solution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>C and C++ developers can use compilers for several platforms and render applications to generate transportable in those languages. In particular, C++ is a big key holder in the mechanism’s advancement in the right direction with object-based programming for the data structure platform. It is a competitive language that solves a variety of problems with the right concepts for developers. The high-performance languages are both C and C++. As a result, it uses them in applications that are of vital importance to performance, such as client/server applications, commercial products such as Adobe and Firefox and video games.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Go</h3>
            <p>Developed by Google over a decade ago as a programming language that could incorporate the best parts of other languages (e.g., C++ runtime productivity and Python reading) to meet the needs of programmers working on enormous projects. Recognised as Golang. It has gained popularity among many large IT businesses, complementing its clear and modern structure and familiarity with syntax. Companies that use Go as their programming language include Google, Uber, Twitch, Dropbox, and many others. Go is also gaining popularity among data scientists for its agility and efficiency. “Go is the most common language of opportunity to learn by far among working professionals. 32% of skilled developers want to learn the language,” says Sachin Gupta, CEO and co-founder of HackerEarth. Alexey Yelenevych, adding that Go appears more frequently, making it a language to watch out for in 2021. It might even get BIGGER in the coming years!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>will not differ from other technologies and digital transformations. There are a few programming languages that will flourish with time. So, which programming languages, in your view, will continue to dominate in future? CONSIDER & ACT WISELY!
